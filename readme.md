# Menstrual Hygiene Survey — My Voice for Hygiene

This Django-powered website is designed to amplify learner voices around menstrual hygiene. It provides a safe, anonymous space for students to share their challenges, ideas, and feedback — helping educators, guardians, and advocates understand real needs. The platform supports CBC-aligned classroom integration, youth-led research, and digital literacy through ethical data collection and storytelling.
Built to empower Neema’s advocacy mission, My Voice for Hygiene blends technology, empathy, and education — turning personal experiences into collective action.
